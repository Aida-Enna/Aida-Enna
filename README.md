### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
I'm the leader of Arks-Layer, the group responsible for the [PSO2 Fleet discord](http://discord.gg/PSO2), [the website (full of tutorials, simulators, guides and more!)](https://na.arks-layer.com), the English translation patch for PSO2JP, and tons of other sutff! I'm also the developer of the PSO2 Tweaker (and various other things), translator/editor, community administrator, and more! If it's related to PSO2, I'm probably involved in it one way or another.

I also run various FFXIV communities, make tools, and help out with [the XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher) (and other projects!)

I also like to dabble in other stuff/fix broken things I come across in my travels through the internet.
